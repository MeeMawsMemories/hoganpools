      <h2 class="gunite-hero__heading">The Craftsmanship of Gunite Pools</h2>
      <p class="gunite-hero__text">When you choose a gunite or concrete pool, you’re not limited by shape or size. Whether your dream is a sleek, modern rectangular pool or a more organic, freeform design, the options are limitless.</p>

      <h2 class="gunite-hero__heading">Personalization and Longevity</h2>
      <p class="gunite-hero__text">Gunite pools stand out for their ability to blend seamlessly into your outdoor space while offering unparalleled durability. Unlike fiberglass pools, which are mass-produced, gunite pools are custom-built directly on-site, allowing for unique designs and personalized features. With proper care, your gunite pool can provide enjoyment for 15–20 years or more.</p>
