        <h3>Consultation and Design</h3>
        <p>
          The journey to your dream pool starts with a detailed consultation where we listen to your ideas, needs,
          and vision. Our team works closely with you to design a pool that complements your landscape and adheres
          to local regulations. Once we finalize the design, we’ll take care of securing the required permits and
          approvals to begin construction.
        </p>

        <h3>Excavation</h3>
        <p>
          Next, we use heavy machinery to dig the pool area, carefully following the dimensions from the design.
          This step creates a solid foundation for your pool, ensuring everything is perfectly aligned for a
          structurally sound result.
        </p>

        <h3>Reinforcement and Plumbing</h3>
        <p>
          We then install a steel rebar framework to reinforce the pool structure. This provides stability and
          supports the gunite application. During this phase, we also install the plumbing system for water
          circulation and filtration to keep your pool running smoothly.
        </p>

        <h3>Applying Gunite</h3>
        <p>
          Gunite, a durable blend of cement, sand, and water, is sprayed to form the pool shell. This versatile
          material can be shaped to suit any design, allowing for creative features and personalized touches in your pool.
        </p>

        <h3>Filling the Pool</h3>
        <p>
          After construction is complete, we fill the pool with water and balance the chemicals to make certain it’s
          safe and ready for use. Our team conducts thorough testing to verify that all systems are functioning properly.
          After a brief settling period, your new pool is ready to transform your backyard.
        </p>

        <h3>Ongoing Care</h3>
        <p>
          To keep your pool in pristine condition, regular maintenance is essential. Gunite pools require consistent care
          to prevent algae buildup and maintain clear, clean water. With regular cleaning, chemical checks, and professional
          servicing, your pool will continue to bring joy and relaxation for many years to come.
